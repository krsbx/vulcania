# Roadmap

Phases are ordered so that each one has a demoable exit and de-risks the
next. Phase 1 is the pivotal one: it proves or kills the chunky-ABI thesis
before anything else gets built on it.

## Phase 0 — SDL FFI vertical slice ✅ (2026-10-30)

- [x] Monorepo: `packages/*` + `tools/*`, ESLint import-boundary rules
      enforcing the layering.
- [x] Port flying-pan's Clang AST parser into `tools/codegen/`; add the
      FFI-table generators (bun:ffi + node:ffi) and the numeric-`#define`
      scanner (see FFI.md).
- [x] Generate SDL3 tables: 1087 functions, 95 enums, 245 defines; 144
      FFI-unsafe exclusions reported (callbacks, variadics, struct-by-value).
- [x] `@vulcania/bindings`: runtime detection, SDL3 dylib resolution
      (`VULCANIA_SDL3_PATH` → platform paths → soname), `sdl` hardcore tier.
- [x] `examples/hello.ts`: window + clear + event polling, zero compiled
      code.

**Exit (met):** an SDL3 window clears to a color from pure TypeScript on
**Bun (bun:ffi)** and **Node ≥ 26.9 (node:ffi)** — `bun run examples/hello.ts
--selftest` and `node examples/hello.ts --selftest` both pass, plus a
headless smoke (`bun run smoke`).

## Phase 1 — Batched renderer in TypeScript (the thesis test, zero C) ✅ (2026-10-30)

Revised: the `libvulcania` C core is retired — SDL_Renderer's GPU backend +
`SDL_RenderGeometryRaw` + `SDL_SetGPURenderState` cover it entirely through
FFI (see PLATFORM.md).

- [x] Renderer module in `@vulcania/gpu`: GPU-backend renderer per window
      (`SDL_CreateRendererWithProperties`, "gpu" backend confirmed on
      macOS), batch accumulator into a reused vertex buffer, flush =
      `SDL_RenderGeometry` per texture batch. (Buffer since corrected to
      SDL3's 32-byte float-color `SDL_Vertex` — the SDL2-era 20-byte
      packed-u32 layout silently draws nothing.)
- [x] Texture path: procedural pixels → `SDL_CreateTextureWithProperties` + `SDL_UpdateTexture`, drawn through the textured batch. (Also fixed
      en route: the codegen dropped every enum-by-value param function —
      77 recovered — and node:ffi returns raw addresses for `'string'`
      returns, now converted in the node loaders.)
- [x] **Phase 2 core (2026-10-31)** — `examples/showcase.ts` verified on
      Bun + Node: scissor clip push/pop (`SDL_SetRenderClipRect`), rounded
      rects via CPU tessellation (fan from center, 12-seg corners), real
      PNG through the `image` tier (runtime-generated via surface +
      `SDL_SavePNG` → `IMG_LoadTexture`), and text via the `ttf` tier
      (`TTF_RenderText_Blended` with the SDL_Color-as-u32 ABI packing and
      the SDL3 `length` param, per-run texture cache, white glyphs + tint).
      Codegen hardened further: enum-tag stripping, returned-as-pointer
      handle rule (`SDL_Texture`/`SDL_Surface`/`SDL_Rect` all typed
      correctly), and the DATA_STRUCTS allowlist.
- [ ] SDF shaders via `SDL_SetGPURenderState` — deferred to a Phase 2.5
      spike. Everything needed is bound and confirmed: `SDL_CreateGPURenderState`,
      the fragment-shader create-info, and the device via
      `SDL_PROP_RENDERER_GPU_DEVICE_POINTER` ("SDL.renderer.gpu.device").
      Requires the SDL_shadercross offline toolchain; CPU tessellation
      ships meanwhile.

**Exit (met):** 10k rects at 60fps with ≤ 10 FFI calls/frame, on Node and
Bun — measured **avg 0.35ms/frame (≈2,850 fps), p99 < 1ms, 6 calls/frame,
`renderer: gpu` on both runtimes** (Apple M-series; ~33× the 60fps budget).

## Phase 2 — Renderer core ✅ (2026-10-31)

Revised mid-phase: the zero-C decision routes decoration through the SDL
tiers instead of porting stb_truetype / stb_image C sources, and the
install-time source build disappeared along with libvulcania — nothing
compiles at all.

- [x] Scissor clipping — `SDL_SetRenderClipRect` push/pop around batch
      flushes (`GpuRenderer.pushClip`/`popClip`). (2026-10-31)
- [x] Text via the SDL3_ttf tier — per-run texture cache, white glyphs +
      tint; supersedes the stb_truetype atlas port. (2026-10-31)
- [x] Image textures via the SDL3_image tier — `IMG_LoadTexture`, runtime
      PNG through surface + `SDL_SavePNG`; supersedes
      `vulcania_image_decode`. (2026-10-31)
- [x] Decoration layers in `@vulcania/widgets`' paint walk — shadow (stacked
      rounded-rect falloff), border (oversized shape), background
      (rounded when radius is set). (2026-10-31)
- [x] ~~Install-time source build~~ — dropped with the zero-C decision:
      zero compiled artifacts is the feature.
- [ ] → SDF rounded-rect/border/shadow shader + `flags` dispatch is the
      **Phase 2.5 spike** (see phase 1 notes); CPU tessellation ships.

**Exit (met):** the "kitchen sink" window — `examples/showcase.ts`
(decorated boxes, clips, images, text) and `examples/gallery.ts` (the
widget-layer kitchen sink) render on Node and Bun; `bun test` includes
pixel-readback guards for the geometry/vertex ABI and batch isolation.

## Phase 3.5 — Widget parity batch 1 (paint-only) (2026-10-31)

vulcania shipped 4 widgets against flying-pan's ~14. The paint-only widgets
port now; interaction widgets wait for the phase 4 dispatch.

- [x] Shared fill painters — continuous + stepped fills (orientation/
      direction aware, buffer behind main fill), color-stop resolution,
      inline value labels (`formatValueLabel`: percent / fraction / value).
- [x] `ProgressBar` — horizontal/vertical, forward/backward, stepped mode
      (`steps` + `stepGap`), buffer track, `colorStops`, inline label.
- [x] `CircularProgress` — ring (`thickness < 1`) or pie (`≥ 1`), start
      angle, clockwise/counter-clockwise, buffer arc; backed by new
      `GpuRenderer.fillArc`/`fillRing` tessellation primitives.
- [x] `Meter` — HTML-`<meter>` low/high/optimum zones mapped to the
      success/warning/error palette.
- Indeterminate motion waits for phase 4's AnimationManager; determinate
  paints today.

**Exit:** the new widgets render through the headless harness with golden
snapshots and in the gallery, on Node and Bun.

## Phase 2.5 — SDF decoration spike (parked)

- [ ] `SDL_SetGPURenderState` + a fragment shader for rounded-rect /
      border / shadow; `flags` dispatch in the paint walk replaces the
      stacked-layer approximation.
- Everything needed is bound and confirmed: `SDL_CreateGPURenderState`,
  the fragment-shader create-info, and the device via
  `SDL_PROP_RENDERER_GPU_DEVICE_POINTER` ("SDL.renderer.gpu.device").
  Requires the SDL_shadercross offline toolchain.

**Exit:** hairline-smooth decoration at any radius, no CPU tessellation
in the paint path.

## Phase 3 — Layout + reconciler ✅ (2026-10-31)

- [x] Port flying-pan's flexbox engine into `@vulcania/layout` (2026-10-31)
      — GL coupling stripped, `LayoutContext` minimal + injected (was
      aliased to the renderer's PaintContext), single-object params kept,
      per-run text measurement via the `ttf` tier. 8 headless tests green
      on the full semantic surface; see docs/LAYOUT.md.
- [x] Port reconciler + `stableId` + `StateStore` into `@vulcania/widgets`
      (2026-10-31) — keyed children, identity short-circuit, mount/update/
      unmount hooks, state destroy-on-unmount.
- [x] **Headless harness** (2026-10-31) — `renderHeadless()` runs tree →
      reconcile → layout → recorded paint ops with a null GPU (injected
      text measurement + interaction states); golden snapshots over layout
      trees and op buffers via `toMatchSnapshot`.

**Exit (met):** widget tree → layout → paint ops entirely in `bun test`,
no window; CI runs the suite plus showcase/gallery selftests on both
runtimes.

## Phase 4 — Interactions + animation

- [x] Package split (2026-11-01) — `@vulcania/widgets` was four concerns in
      one package; now `@vulcania/core` (contracts: payloads, enums,
      StateStore, design tokens, InteractionStates), `@vulcania/interactions`
      (pointer/focus/scroll dispatchers + hit-test), and `@vulcania/paint`
      (generic walk + Painter surfaces + fill/shape/shadow primitives)
      are their own packages, with per-widget painters co-located in
      `@vulcania/widgets` and injected through `PaintContext.painters`.
      Dependencies point strictly downward; see ARCHITECTURE.md.
- [x] Text wrapping (2026-11-01) — labels wrap to the available width
      like the web (default on; `textWrap: TextWrap.NoWrap` opts out).
      Lines are computed at measure time against the parent content
      width ∩ `maxWidth`, height grows by line count (`lineHeight` is
      now consumed), and the painter draws one run per line from
      `node.textLayout` — the first net-new layout capability beyond
      the flying-pan port.

Foundation work (each item unblocks a widget batch):

- [x] Pointer dispatch port (2026-10-31) — pointer dispatcher + hit-test
      from flying-pan's `flying/interactions`, adapted from the GLFW input
      manager to decoded event-fed input (headless-testable): hover
      enter/leave with press cancellation on drag-off, opt-in press
      capture (`payload.capturePointer`), click = down+up on the same
      widget, double-click counting. Replaces gallery.ts's hand-rolled
      hit-test.
- [x] Focus dispatcher (2026-11-01) — click-to-focus (nearest focusable
      ancestor), dead-space blur, tab/shift-tab cycling, key/char routing
      to the focused widget, Enter/Space synth-click on activable widgets.
- [x] Scroll dispatcher + clipping (2026-11-01) — wheel → nearest
      scrollable ancestor (`overflow: scroll/auto`), clamped at content
      bounds, velocity EMA + friction coasting, `offsetOf` feeding
      `LayoutContext.scrollOffsetOf`; paint-walk `pushClip`/`popClip`
      scissor clipping (pixel-tested on the software driver).
- [x] Controlled/uncontrolled state, pseudo-states (2026-11-01) —
      controlled `checked`/`value` + change handlers re-render the app;
      uncontrolled `defaultChecked`/`defaultValue` persist in StateStore
      keyed by stableId (radio groups by `name`), painted through
      `PaintContext.stateStore`; pseudo-states (`_hover`/`_focus`/
      `_pressed`/`_checked`/`_disabled`) ride the dispatchers' `statesOf`.
- [x] AnimationManager port (2026-11-01) — `@vulcania/animation`: the
      transition engine (applyOverlay with mid-flight retargeting and
      parse-normalized color settling), easings, and the clock that
      drives indeterminate progress motion, the caret blink, and
      ViewStyle transitions. Injected through PaintContext.animationManager.
- [x] Font manager (2026-11-02) — `@vulcania/fonts`: named font
      descriptors (path + size) materialized per renderer as TtfFont
      instances; "default" is a registered identifier (apps load a
      specific font and alias it — never a hardcoded system font).
      Label.font resolves through PaintContext.fonts; layout measures
      the same font via measureText's fontName parameter.
- [x] Multi-window (2026-11-01) — `@vulcania/app`, the application shell:
      App with a window registry (create/destroy keyed by SDL windowID),
      event decode + routing, and a run loop that reconciles → lays out →
      dispatches → paints every window each frame. Per-window renderer +
      font + reconciler + state + dispatchers (SDL textures are
      renderer-scoped; stableIds and hover/focus state are per-tree).
      flying-pan's dashboard flow is restored in examples/dashboard.ts.

Widget parity batches — each batch lands when its capability exists, not
before (a widget painted without its input path is the hand-wired glue
the dispatcher exists to replace):

| Batch | Widgets                                     | Needs                                                                                                                                     | Status                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `ProgressBar`, `CircularProgress`, `Meter`  | paint only                                                                                                                                | ✅ Phase 3.5 (2026-10-31)                                 |
| 2     | `Checkbox`, `Toggle`, `Radio`, `RadioGroup` | click dispatch + controlled checked state                                                                                                 | ✅ (2026-10-31)                                           |
| 3     | `SliderBar`, `CircularSlider`               | pointer drag (press capture, move tracking, value mapping) + ticks/tick labels                                                            | ✅ (2026-10-31)                                           |
| 4     | `TextInput`                                 | keyboard + focus dispatch, char/pointer handlers, selection range, scroll-x recompute — the hardest widget in flying-pan                  | ✅ (2026-11-01) — clipboard wired via the injectable seam |
| 4.5   | `TextArea` (net-new — flying-pan has none)  | shared editing core + text wrap + font prop; Enter keydown, visual-line Up/Down with goal column, y-position click mapping, scroll-follow | ✅ (2026-11-02) — dashboard notes demo                    |
| 5     | `Canvas`, `Custom` painter                  | CanvasContext + Path2D/tessellation port                                                                                                  | phase 5                                                   |
| 6     | `RangeSlider` (the last flying-pan-parity widget) + keyboard on all three sliders | dual-handle `[low, high]` range: nearest-handle picking (low wins ties), no-cross clamping, activeHandle in the store so drags AND keyboard survive controlled rebuilds; arrows/Shift ×10/Home/End on SliderBar, RangeSlider, CircularSlider (focus-required) | ✅ (2026-11-03) |
- [x] Uncontrolled widgets complete (2026-11-08): checkbox/toggle
      (`defaultChecked`), radio (`defaultValue` + named store state),
      text-input/text-area (`defaultValue` + persisted editing state),
      and now the slider family — `defaultValue` + store-backed value
      through resolveSliderValue/resolveRangeSliderState (combined
      `{low, high, activeHandle}` object so the grabbed handle and the
      values share one key); keyboard included. Display-only widgets
      (progress/meter/image) have no value state by design.

Batch 5's `WidgetType` slots exist (`Custom` is already in the layout
enums); `List` (virtualized — `listLayoutFlex` already ported) and a
`Flex` factory are candidate mini-batches after batch 3.

**List + Flex factories ✅ (2026-11-03)** — `List` and `Flex` in
`@vulcania/widgets`, flying-pan's exact API. `List({itemCount, itemSize,
renderItem, overscan?, orientation?})` is a fixed-extent windowing list
over the already-ported `listLayoutFlex` (visible window + spacers per
frame, negative per-index stableIds so hover/state survives scrolling);
`Flex({direction, gap?, justifyContent?, alignItems?})` lowers its
shortcuts into the style and flows through the generic pass. Dashboard
gained the virtual-list section (vertical + horizontal 10k items).

**Exit:** the flying-pan example apps rebuilt on vulcania — batches 1–4
complete, interactive at 60fps.

- [x] `examples/dashboard.ts` (2026-11-01) — flying-pan's
      `simple-dashboard.ts` rebuilt on vulcania: the same scrollable
      sections and palette, controlled widgets with live readouts, the
      animated indeterminate progress, slider-linked circular progress,
      and flying-pan's exact text-field focus transition. Selftested at
      240 frames on Bun and Node 26. Its multi-window
      section is restored (real second window through @vulcania/app);
      its virtual-list section landed 2026-11-03 (two 10k `List`s);
      Canvas 2D and tessellation land with the rest of phase 5
      (Canvas/Path2D).

## Phase 5 — Devtools (the debuggability payoff)

- [x] `@vulcania/devtools`: the inspector (2026-11-03) — node:http + SSE
      (NOT Bun.serve: dual-runtime), live widget tree at ≤4 Hz, click-to-select
      with the in-app 2px accent outline (`AppWindow.paintOverlay` seam),
      resolved styles + states via the paint walk's own
      `effectiveStatesFor`, draw-call/vertex/frame graph from
      `GpuRenderer.stats`. `App.run` now awaits its frame delay (flying-pan's
      yielding loop) so an in-process server gets event-loop time. The
      umbrella also absorbed tools/devtools' FFI setup. `examples/inspector.ts`
      runs it always-on; dashboard/gallery opt in via `VULCANIA_DEVTOOLS=1`.
- [ ] Canvas 2D `CanvasContext` port onto the encoder.
- [ ] Path2D/tessellation port for arbitrary vector paths; TS SVG parser
      feeding it.

**Exit:** the "hard to debug" complaint has a named tool: open a browser tab,
click a widget, see why.

## Phase 6 — Audio + packaging

- [ ] SDL3 audio stream behind `vulcania_audio_*`.
- [ ] Distribution: app-bundling story (app authors ship the compiled binary
      — their users compile nothing); optional prebuilt platform packages as
      opt-in convenience; codesigning + icons for macOS/Windows.

## Deliberately deferred (with reasons)

| Item                        | Why deferred                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accessibility tree          | Large, orthogonal; design ABI hooks now (`stableId` is already the key), build later. |
| IME / HarfBuzz shaping      | HarfBuzz is a dependency and a half; UTF-8 simple text covers v1 apps.                |
| Vulkan/Metal/D3D12 backends | Come free via SDL_GPU from phase 1 — nothing deferred.                                |
| wgpu / Dawn                 | Only if SDL_GPU ever hits a wall (see PLATFORM.md).                                   |
| ~~Multi-window~~            | ✅ Landed 2026-11-01 (`@vulcania/app`) — struck from this list.                          |
| GPU-instanced text          | Only if the atlas-quads model misses 60fps targets.                                   |
