 * @vulcania/bindings — the ONLY package that talks to native code.

 * One folder per library under `libraries/<name>/` (loaders, path
 * resolution, generated tables). Adding a library = adding a folder +
 * one re-export line here. Nothing library-specific lives above this file.
 *
 * Libraries currently load eagerly at import; if one ever becomes
 * optional-heavy, give it a lazy `loadXxx()` instead of eager top-level await.
